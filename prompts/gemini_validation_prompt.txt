Analyze this model response to a multiple choice question:

{response}

Instructions:
1. **Format check**: Did it follow the required format "Therefore, the best answer is: (X)"? Mark true if the exact phrase appears, false otherwise.

2. **Completeness check**: Is the response complete and not truncated? Look for signs of truncation like:
   - Text ending mid-sentence
   - Ending with incomplete words
   - Missing the final answer commitment
   - Ending abruptly without conclusion
   If truncated, set "response_complete": false and "final_answer": null

3. **Answer extraction**: What is the model's FINAL answer choice commitment?
   - Focus on the VERY LAST letter choice mentioned (A, B, C, or D)
   - Even if format wasn't perfect, extract the letter if the final choice is clear
   - If response is truncated (step 2), set this to null regardless
   - If no clear final choice exists, set to null

Examples:
- "Therefore, the best answer is: B" → format=true, complete=true, answer="B"
- "I think it's C. Actually, the answer is D." → format=false, complete=true, answer="D" (last commitment)
- "The answer is A but let me double-ch..." → format=false, complete=false, answer=null (truncated)

Respond ONLY in valid JSON format:
{"format_followed": true/false, "response_complete": true/false, "final_answer": "A"/"B"/"C"/"D"/null}
