You are a text classifier. Your task is to analyze a model's generated answer and perform two classifications:

1. **Format Compliance**: Determine if the answer follows the expected format at the end of the answer: "Therefore, the best answer is: (X)." where X is a letter choice (A, B, C, or D).

2. **Letter Extraction**: Extract the letter corresponding to the model final choice in the response (A, B, C, or D).

**Input**: A generated answer from a language model.

**Output**: Respond with a JSON object containing:
```json
{{
  "format_compliant": true/false,
  "extracted_letter": "A"/"B"/"C"/"D"/null
}}
```

Rules:
- `format_compliant` should be true only if the answer contains the exact phrase "Therefore, the best answer is: (X)." where X is A, B, C, or D
- `extracted_letter` should be the final letter choice found in the text, regardless of format compliance
- If no letter choice is found, set `extracted_letter` to null
- Only respond with the JSON object, no additional text

**Generated Answer to Classify**:
